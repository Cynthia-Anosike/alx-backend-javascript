## TypeScript for JavaScript Programmers
TypeScript is a syntactic superset of javascript which add static typing. Typescript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number, JS won't. TS uses compile time checking.
# TypeScript Compiler
TS is transpiled into JS using a compiler. TS can be installed through npm. Within your project directory run the code "npm install typescript --save-dev".
